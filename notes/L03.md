# Compiling Code, Procedures and Stacks

## Dealing with Constants

### Small constants

in 12-bit

use `addi`

### Large constants

in 20-bit

use `lui` (load upper immediately)

Example:

```RISC-V
li x4, 0x123456
```

->

```RISC-V
lui x4, 0x123       ; x4 = 0x123000, limit here is 20 bits
addi x4, x4, 0x456  ; limit here is 12 bits
```

Another example:

```RISC-V
li x4, 0x12
```

->

```RISC-V
addi x4, x4, 0x12
```

## Compiling Loops

An interesting example:

C code:

```C
while (expr) {
    while-body
}
```

can be translated into:

```RISC-V
while:
    (compile expr into xN)
	beqz expr, endwhile
	(compile while-body)
	j while
endwhile:
```

and can be optimized as:

```RISC-V
j compare
while:
    (compile while-body)
compare:
    (compile expr into xN)
	bnez xN, while
```

after being optimized, only 1 control instruction on 1 iteration.

## RISC-V Stack

```text
STACK

-----  lower address
|   |
-----       /\
|   |      /||\ Push
-----       ||
 ...        ||
-----
|   |  higher address
-----
```

### stack pointer

Point to the top of stack. _sp_ is _x2_.

Pop: sp+, Push: sp-

Example of using the stack:

```RISC-V
addi sp, sp, -8
sw ra, 0(sp)
sw a0, 4(sp)

lw ra, 0(sp)
lw a0, r(sp)
```
